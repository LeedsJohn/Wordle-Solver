# Wordle-Solver
I created this Wordle Solver to learn more about C++ when I was first beginning to use it. Because of this, there are a lot of stylistic changes I would 
make if I were to rewrite this. The most obvious of these is dividing my code into multiple files.

Unfortunately, I do not feel comfortable including the 
word lists I used for this as I found them from someone else. Please check out this project if you would like to view them: https://github.com/bnprks/wordle_solver 

Ultimately, this solver takes 3.8 guesses on average to solve Wordle. However, there are roughly 20 words (out of several thousand) where it fails to solve
Wordle in <=6 guesses.
